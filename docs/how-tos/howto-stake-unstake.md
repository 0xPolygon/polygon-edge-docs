title: How to set up and use Proof of Stake (PoS)
---

## Overview

This guide goes into detail on how to set up a Proof of Stake network with the Polygon Edge, how to stake funds for nodes
to become validators and how to unstake funds.

It **highly encouraged** to read and go through
the [setup IBFT locally](/docs/get-started/set-up-ibft-locally)
/ [setup IBFT on the cloud](/docs/get-started/set-up-ibft-on-the-cloud) sections, before going along
with this PoS guide. These sections outline the steps needed to start a Proof of Authority (PoA) cluster with the
Polygon Edge.

:::warning PoA and PoS chains incompatible 
A chain that has previously been running in PoA mode, cannot be converted to
a PoS chain during execution, and vice versa.

The only way to switch IBFT mechanisms is to reset the chain and start it in the corresponding mode (PoA or PoS) from
scratch.
:::

Currently, there is no limit to the number of validators that can stake funds on the Staking Smart Contract.

## Staking Smart Contract

The repo for the Staking Smart Contract is located [here](https://github.com/0xPolygon/staking-contracts).

It holds the necessary testing scripts, ABI files and most importantly the Staking Smart Contract itself.

## Setting up an N node cluster

Setting up a cluster with the Polygon Edge is covered in
the [setup IBFT locally](/docs/get-started/set-up-ibft-locally)
/ [setup IBFT on the cloud](/docs/get-started/set-up-ibft-on-the-cloud) sections.

The **only difference** between setting up a PoS and PoA cluster is in the genesis generation part.

**When generating the genesis file for a PoS cluster, an additional flag is needed `--pos`**:

```bash
go run main.go genesis --pos ...
```

## Setting the length of an epoch

Epochs are covered in detail in the [Epoch Blocks](/docs/consensus/pos-concepts#epoch-blocks) section.

To set the size of an epoch for a cluster (in blocks), when generating the genesis file, an additional flag is
specified `--epoch-size`:

```bash
go run main.go genesis --epoch-size 50
```

This value specified in the genesis file that the epoch size should be `50` blocks.

The default value for the size of an epoch (in blocks) is `100000`.

:::info Lowering the epoch length 
As outlined in the [Epoch Blocks](/docs/consensus/pos-concepts#epoch-blocks) section,
epoch blocks are used to update the validator sets for nodes.

The default epoch length in blocks (`100000`) may be a long time to way for validator set updates. Considering that new
blocks are added ~2s, it would take ~55.5h for the validator set to possibly change.

Setting a lower value for the epoch length ensures that the validator set is updated more frequently.

## Using the Staking Smart Contract scripts

### Prerequisites

The Staking Smart Contract repo is a Hardhat project, which requires NPM.

To initialize it correctly, in the main directory run:

```bash
npm install
````

### Setting up the provided helper scripts

Scripts for interacting with the deployed Staking Smart Contract are located on
the [Staking Smart Contract repo](https://github.com/0xPolygon/staking-contracts).

Create an `.env` file with the following parameters in the Smart Contracts repo location:

```bash
POLYGON_SDK_JSONRPC_URL=http://localhost:10002
PRIVATE_KEYS=0x0454f3ec51e7d6971fc345998bb2ba483a8d9d30d46ad890434e6f88ecb97544
STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001001
```

Where the parameters are:

* **POLYGON_SDK_JSONRPC_URL** - the JSON-RPC endpoint for the running node
* **PRIVATE_KEYS** - private keys of the staker address
* **STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS** - the address of the staking smart contract (
  default `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001001`)

### Staking funds

:::info Staking address 
The Staking Smart Contract is pre-deployed at address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001001`.

Any kind of interaction with the staking mechanism is done through the Staking Smart Contract at the specified address.

To learn more about the Staking Smart Contract, please visit
the [Staking Smart Contract](/docs/consensus/pos-concepts#contract-pre-deployment)
section.
:::

In order to become part of the validator set, an address needs to stake a certain amount of funds above a threshold.

Currently, the threshold for becoming part of the validator set is `1 ETH`.

Staking can be initiated by calling the `stake` method of the Staking Smart Contract, and specifying a value `>= 1 ETH`.

After the `.env` file mentioned in
the [previous section](/docs/how-tos/howto-stake-unstake#setting-up-the-provided-helper-scripts) has been set up, and a
chain has been started in PoS mode, staking can be done with the following command in the Staking Smart Contract repo:

```bash
npm run stake
```

The `stake` Hardhat script stakes a default amount of `1 ETH`, which can be changed by modifying the `scripts/stake.ts`
file.

If the funds being staked are `>= 1 ETH`, the validator set on the Staking Smart Contract is updated, and the address
will be part of the validator set starting from the next epoch.

### Unstaking funds

Addresses that have a stake can **only unstake all of their funds** at once.

After the `.env` file mentioned in
the [previous section](/docs/how-tos/howto-stake-unstake#setting-up-the-provided-helper-scripts)
has been set up, and a chain has been started in PoS mode, unstaking can be done with the following command in the
Staking Smart Contract repo:

```bash
npm run unstake
```

### Fetching the list of stakers

All addresses that stake funds are saved to the Staking Smart Contract.

After the `.env` file mentioned in
the [previous section](/docs/how-tos/howto-stake-unstake#setting-up-the-provided-helper-scripts)
has been set up, and a chain has been started in PoS mode, fetching the list of validators can be done with the
following command in the Staking Smart Contract repo:

```bash
npm run info
```
