## Requirements

### Setup IBFT

To setup the network with 4 active validator nodes localy is covered in the [setup IBFT locally](/docs//how-tos/howto-setup-ibft/howto-set-ibft-locally) section.

## Overview
This guide goes into detail on how to add new validator node to active IBFT network with 4 validator nodes.

## Step 1: Initialize data folders for IBFT and generate validator keysâ€‹ for new node

In order to get up and running with IBFT, you need to initialize the data folders, for new node:

````bash
go run main.go secrets init --data-dir test-chain-5
````

This command will print the validator key (address) and the node ID. You will need the validator key (address) for the next step.

## Step 2: From other validator nodes proposes a new candidate to be added

Other candidades needs to propose a new node to become validator. 

Example of how to validator node on grpc address: 127.0.0.1:10000 to propose node with validator key (address): 0x8B15464F8233F718c8605B16eBADA6fc09181fC2:

````bash
go run main.go ibft propose --grpc-address 127.0.0.1:10000 --addr  0x8B15464F8233F718c8605B16eBADA6fc09181fC2 --vote auth
````

The structure of the ibft commands is covered in the [CLI Commands](/docs/cli-commands) section.

## Step 3: Run the client node

Because we are attempting to run the IBFT network where all nodes are on the same machine, we need to take care to avoid port conflicts. 

````bash
go run main.go server --data-dir ./test-chain-5 --chain genesis.json --grpc :50000 --libp2p :50001 --jsonrpc :50002 --seal
````

After featching all blocks, inside your console you will notice that new node is participating in validation

````bash
