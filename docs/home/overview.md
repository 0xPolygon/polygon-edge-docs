Polygon SDK is a modular and extensible framework for building Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks.

This repository is the first implementation of Polygon SDK, written in Golang. Other implementations, written in other
programming languages might be introduced in the future. If you would like to contribute to this or any future
implementation, please reach out to the [Polygon team](mailto:contact@polygon.technology).
