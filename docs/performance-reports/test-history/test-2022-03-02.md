### Summary

This test was done to measure the SC ERC20 token transfers and SC ERC721 token minting functionality with heavy loads and speed of the transactions.

The goal was to check if everything was working as expected during heavy loads. That was also the reason weâ€™ve introduced gas metrics in the loadbot output, which shows us if the blocks are filled with transactions properly.

All transactions were sent to the single node via GRPC API, and the receipts were received via JSON-RPC API. After all transactions were done, gas information was read from each block, using the eth_getBlockByNumber JSON-RPC method.

Our aim was not to strive to reach a maximum possible TPS,
since block gas limit & block time are set to sane values that don't consume much system resources, and would allow this to run on commodity hardware.

### Results ERC20

| Transactions failed | 0 |
| Transactions succeeded | 5000 |
| ERC20 transaction run time | 76.681690s |
| SC Deploy time | 4.048250s |

### Results ERC721

| Metric | Value |
