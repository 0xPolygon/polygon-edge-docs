## Overview

A node has to communicate with other nodes on the network, in order to exchange useful information.<br />
To accomplish this task, the Polygon SDK leverages the battle-tested **libp2p** framework.

The choice to go with **libp2p** is primarily focused on:
* **Speed** - libp2p has a significant performance improvement over devp2p (used in GETH and other clients)
* **Extensibility** - it serves as a great foundation for other features of the system
* **Modularity** - libp2p is modular by nature, just like the Polygon SDK. This gives greater flexibility, especially when parts of the Polygon SDK need to be swappable

## GRPC

On top of **libp2p**, the Polygon SDK uses the **GRPC** protocol. <br />
Technically, the Polygon SDK uses several GRPC protocols, which will be covered later on.

The GRPC layer helps abstract all the request / reply protocols and simplifies the streaming protocols needed for the SDK to function.

GRPC relies on **Protocol Buffers** to define *services* and *message structures*. <br />
The services and structures are defined in *.proto* files, which are compiled and are language-agnostic.

Earlier, we mentioned that the Polygon SDK leverages several GRPC protocols.<br />
This was done in order to boost the overall UX for the node operator, something which often lags with clients like GETH and Parity.

The node operator has a better overview of what is going on with the system by calling the GRPC service, instead of sifting through logs to find the information they're looking for.

### GRPC for Node Operators

The following section might seem familiar, because it was briefly covered in the [CLI Commands](/docs/home/cli-commands) section.

The GRPC service that is intented to be used by **node operators** is defined like so:
````go title="minimal/proto/system.proto"
service System {
    // GetInfo returns info about the client
    rpc GetStatus(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (ServerStatus);

    // PeersAdd adds a new peer
    rpc PeersAdd(PeersAddRequest) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);

    // PeersList returns the list of peers
    rpc PeersList(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (PeersListResponse);

    // PeersInfo returns the info of a peer
    rpc PeersStatus(PeersStatusRequest) returns (Peer);

    // Subscribe subscribes to blockchain events
    rpc Subscribe(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (stream BlockchainEvent);
}
````
:::tip 
The CLI commands actually call the implementations of these service methods. 

These methods are implemented in ***minimal/system_service.go***.

### GRPC for Other Nodes

The Polygon SDK also implements several service methods that are used by other nodes on the network. <br />
The mentioned service is described in the **[Protocol](/docs/modules/protocol)** section.
